Structure                                                         Union
It can be created using a keyword "struct"                        It can be created using a keyword "union"
The total memory occupied by structure variable is                The total memory occupied by union variable is same as largest memory
 summation of memory occupied by individual structure elements    occupied by union elements
It takes more memory as compared to union                         It takes less memory as compared to structure
We can access individual elements simultaneously                  We cannot access individual elements simultaneously
It is more efficient as compared to union                         It is less efficient as compared to structure
It takes less execution time as compared to union                 It takes more execution time as compared to structure
