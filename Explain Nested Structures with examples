A nested structure in C is a structure within structure.
One structure can be defined inside another strucure in the same way structure members are declared inside a structure.
We can access the member of the nested structure by
Outer_Structure_Varibale.Inner_Structure_Variable.Inner_Structure_Element
Example:
#include <stdio.h>
struct student
{
int roll;
char name[30];
struct marks
{
int p,c,m;
}mk;
};
int main()
{
struct student s1, s2;
int t1,t2;
printf("Enter roll number name and marks of physics chemistry and maths of student 1=");
scanf("%d%s%d%d%d",&s1.roll,&s1.name,&s1.mk.p,&s1.mk.c,s1.mk.m);
printf("Enter roll number name and marks of physics chemistry and maths of student 2=");
scanf("%d%s%d%d%d",&s2.roll,&s2.name,&s2.mk.p,&s2.mk.c,s2.mk.m);
t1=s1.mk.p+s1.mk.c+s1.mk.m;
t2=s2.mk.p+s2.mk.c+s2.mk.m;
if(t1>t2)
{
printf("\nName of student having highest total=%s",s1.name);
}
else
{
printf("\nName of student having highest total=%s",s2.name);
}
return 0;
}
